* Basic mathematical operators + - * /
* Flow control:  if, elif, else https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#if
* Functions: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#function-definitions
* Home made Unit tests 

## Curriculum Lesson 2:
* boolean comparisons ( >, <, ==, != <=, >=, ) and operators (and, or, not) 
* eval()
* f-strings (typically used by print() ) https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings
